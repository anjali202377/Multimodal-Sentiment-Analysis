# Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis
The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis project aims to enhance the accuracy and depth of emotion detection by integrating diverse data modalities such as text, audio, and images. Traditional sentiment analysis methods, which focus on a single data type, often fail to capture the complexities of human emotions. This project addresses these limitations by combining natural language processing (NLP) for textual analysis, speech processing for vocal tone and emotional cues, and computer vision for image-based sentiment recognition.
The project emphasizes the development of a unified machine learning model capable of processing and fusing information from these modalities. Advanced techniques for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and multimodal fusion are employed to ensure a comprehensive and robust analysis. Applications of this system include mental health services, where real-time sentiment detection can aid in providing emotion-sensitive support, and customer service, where analyzing multimodal feedback can lead to improved experiences.
The prototype system is evaluated using benchmark multimodal datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nuanced emotional states. By leveraging this approach, the project contributes to advancing sentiment analysis technology, with the potential to impact industries such as healthcare, social media monitoring, and conversational AI.
